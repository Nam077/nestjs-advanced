## Project Setup

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nam077/nestjs-advanced.git
   cd nestjs-advanced
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Copy the example environment configuration file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Start the services using Docker:

   ```bash
   docker-compose --env-file .env.docker up --build
   ```

5. Run database migrations:

   ```bash
   yarn run migration:run
   ```

### Running the Application

- Start in development mode with live reload:

  ```bash
  yarn run start:dev
  ```

- Build and run in production:

  ```bash
  yarn run build
  yarn run start:prod
  ```

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive test coverage with unit tests and end-to-end (E2E) tests.

### Running Tests

- To run all tests:

  ```bash
  yarn run test
  ```

- To run tests in watch mode:

  ```bash
  yarn run test:watch
  ```

- To generate a coverage report:

  ```bash
  yarn run test:cov
  ```

## Linting and Formatting

The project follows strict code quality standards using **ESLint** and **Prettier**. To run lint checks and auto-fix issues:

```bash
yarn run lint
```

To format the code using Prettier:

```bash
yarn run format
```

### Commitlint and Husky

This project uses **Husky** to run Git hooks for pre-commit and pre-push tasks like linting and testing. **Commitlint** enforces conventional commit messages, helping to maintain a clean and consistent Git history.

To make a commit:

```bash
yarn run commit
```

This will prompt you to use Commitizen, which helps format your commit message according to conventional commit standards (e.g., `feat: add user authentication`).

## Jest Testing Configuration

The project is configured to use **Jest** for testing. Here's the Jest configuration included in the project:

```json
{
  "moduleFileExtensions": ["js", "json", "ts"],
  "rootDir": "src",
  "testRegex": ".*\.spec\.ts$",
  "transform": {
    "^.+\.(t|j)s$": "ts-jest"
  },
  "collectCoverageFrom": ["**/*.(t|j)s"],
  "coverageDirectory": "../coverage",
  "testEnvironment": "node"
}
```

This configuration enables test coverage collection, TypeScript support, and running tests in a Node.js environment.
